        <p>Deforestation, clearance, clearcutting, or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that
             is then converted to non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use.
              The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests.
               Between 15 million to 18 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Belgium, are destroyed every year, on average 2,400 
               trees are cut down each minute.
