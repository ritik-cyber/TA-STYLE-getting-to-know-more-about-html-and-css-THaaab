     <p>What is nature? There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals, the birds, the whales and dolphins,
        to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields and so on. 
        Nature is not put together by thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the tiger, 
        that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power.
        Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough.
        Nature is the ant, the bee and all the living things of the earth. Nature is the river, not a particular river, whether the Ganga, 
        the Thames or the Mississippi. Nature is those mountains,
        snow-clad, with dark blue valleys and range of hills meeting the sea. The universe is part of nature.
        One must have a feeling for all this, not destroy it, not kill for one’s pleasure or one’s table.
        We do kill cabbages, the vegetables we eat, but one must draw the line somewhere. 
        If you do not eat vegetables, how will you live? So one must intelligently discern</p>
        <p>One knows all this has been said before in different ways, but we don’t seem to pay much attention. 
        Is it that we are so caught up in our own network of problems, our desires, our urges of pleasure and pain that we never look around,
         never watch the moon? Watch it. Watch with all your eyes and ears, your sense of smell. Watch. Look as though you are looking for the first time. 
         If you can do that, you see for the first time that tree, bush or blade of grass. Then you can see your teacher, your mother or father, your brother or sister,
          for the first time.
          There is an extraordinary feeling about that: the wonder, the strangeness, the miracle of a fresh morning that has never been before and never will be.</p>

          <p>Be in communion with nature, not verbally caught in the description of it, but be a part of it, be aware, feel that you belong to all that, be able to have love for all that, to admire a deer, the lizard on the wall, that broken branch lying on the ground. Look at the evening star or the new moon without the word, without merely saying how beautiful it is and turning your back on it, attracted by something else, but watch that single star and new delicate moon as though for the first time. If there is such communion between you and nature, you can commune with man, with the boy sitting next to you, with your educator or with your parents. We have lost all sense of relationship in which there is not only a verbal statement of affection and concern but also this sense of communion, which is not verbal. It is a sense that we are all together, that we are all human beings, not divided, not broken up, not belonging to any group or race or some idealistic concepts, but that we are all human beings, living on this extraordinary, beautiful earth.</p>
