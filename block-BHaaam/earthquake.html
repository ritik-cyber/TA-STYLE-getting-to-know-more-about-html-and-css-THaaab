        <p>There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust),
             and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is
              in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where 
              the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as
               at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other;
                transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components
                 of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.

            Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent plate boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, megathrust earthquakes,
             including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.
             [4] Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults 
             are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake 
             of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 
             magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in World War II.[5]</p>
