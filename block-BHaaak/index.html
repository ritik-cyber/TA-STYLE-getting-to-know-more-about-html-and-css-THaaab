        <p>Polluting ocean water must be strictly prohibited by all industries straightaway as it causes a lot of water shortage. 
           The excessive use of automobiles, AC’s and ovens emit a lot of Chlorofluorocarbons’ which depletes the ozone layer.
           This, in turn, causes global warming which causes thermal expansion and melting of glaciers.
           Therefore, we should avoid personal use of the vehicle when we can, switch to public transport and carpooling.
            We must invest in solar energy giving a chance for the natural resources to replenish.
